##  What is DSpace?

**DSpace** is a free, open-source platform that helps universities, libraries, and research institutions **store, organize, and share digital content**. Think of it like a digital library where you can keep all your research papers, theses, dissertations, images, videos, and more—safe and accessible for years to come.

It’s trusted by institutions around the world to make academic work more discoverable and to preserve valuable knowledge for future generations.


##  Key Features That Make DSpace Powerful

####  **1. Permanent URLs for Every Item** 
Each submission gets a unique, **permanent link** (called a Handle or DOI). This means you can confidently cite your work knowing the link will always work—no matter what changes behind the scenes.

#### **2. Integrations with Scholarly Tools**

DSpace plays well with others—it integrates with tools like:
- ORCID (for researcher identifiers)
- DOI systems (for digital object identifiers)
- SWORD (for repository deposits)
- and other academic services—enhancing your repository’s reach and interoperability.

####  **3. Open Access & Search Engine Friendly**

DSpace works with academic databases and search engines by supporting standards like **OAI-PMH**, so your work can reach a global audience.

####  **4. Clear, Structured Organization**  
Content in DSpace is neatly organized into **communities**, **sub-communities**, and **collections**. For example, a university might have a Faculty of Science community, with a Computer Science sub-community, and a "Final Year Projects" collection within it. Simple and intuitive.

####  **5. Easy Search and Browse**

Users can **search by title, author, subject, or date**, or just browse through collections. Filters and sorting tools make it easy to find exactly what you’re looking for.

####  **6.  Custom Roles and Permissions**

Whether you're a student submitting a paper or a librarian reviewing entries, DSpace allows admins to assign roles and permissions so everyone has access to just what they need.

####  **7. Flexible Submission Workflow**

DSpace supports multi-step review processes. A submission can be checked by reviewers and editors before it’s officially approved and published.

####  **8. Rich Metadata Support**

DSpace uses metadata (like title, author, subject, etc.) to keep everything well-organized and searchable. It supports standards like Dublin Core to ensure quality cataloging.

####  **9. Multilingual and Customizable**

Want to use DSpace in your own language? No problem. You can also customize how it looks and feels to match your institution’s branding.

####  **10. Preservation for the Long Run**

DSpace is built to keep your content **safe and accessible over time**, using checksums, version control, and backup-friendly features.

####  **11. Usage Statistics**

You can track how often your content is viewed or downloaded, helping you understand how your repository is being used.

### **Role Descriptions in DSpace 8**
1. **Submitter** is the person who uploads items like theses, research papers, or reports to the DSpace repository. Usually, this could be a student, researcher, or faculty member. Their role is to start the submission process by filling out the required metadata (like title, author, and abstract) and uploading their files. Submitters can revise or delete their drafts until the item moves into the review workflow.
2. **Reviewer** is the first person to check a submitted item. Think of them as the quality checker who ensures the work is relevant, complete, and follows basic submission standards. They can either approve the item, request changes, or reject it. Reviewers often leave feedback for the submitter if anything needs improvement. This role is commonly filled by professors, supervisors, or academic staff involved in evaluating student or research work.
3. **Editor** comes in after the reviewer, focusing mainly on the details. Their job is to clean up and verify the metadata — making sure that everything like author names, subjects, and titles are correct and formatted properly. Editors don’t usually change the content itself, but they help make sure submissions are well-organized and searchable. Librarians or metadata specialists often fill this role.
4. **Final Editor** is the last stop before an item is officially published in the repository. They double-check everything — from content to metadata — to make sure it meets the institution’s standards. Once the final editor approves the item, it becomes part of the public repository. This role is typically given to senior library staff or someone with a strong understanding of both metadata and repository policies.
5. **Collection Admin** manages everything within a specific collection — for example, “Final Year Projects 2024.” They oversee submissions, assign roles like reviewers or editors, and make sure the items meet the collection’s standards. Collection admins can also change settings, update descriptions, and handle issues related to that specific collection. They’re usually librarians or departmental coordinators.
6. **Community Admin** is responsible for a whole community, like a faculty or department (e.g., Faculty of Science). They can create collections, assign Collection Admins, and manage policies at the community level. While they don't have full system control like a Site Admin, they play a big role in organizing and maintaining structure across several collections. Faculty administrators or departmental heads usually take on this role.
7. **Site Admin** has full control over the entire DSpace system. They can create users, set up roles, configure workflows, manage metadata schemas, and customize system-wide settings. If something needs to be changed at the platform level — whether it's a bug fix or a new feature — the Site Admin handles it. This is typically the role of an IT admin, system developer, or repository manager.

Moodle will process your CSV file and create new courses based on the provided information.</p> 04 Deleting a course <p>Managers and course creators have the ability to delete courses in Moodle. Course creators can only delete courses they have created within the past 24 hours. This allows users to quickly delete courses created in error without having to contact an administrator.</p> <p>Step:  To delete a course as a manager: Log in to Moodle and go to the Site administration page. Click on Courses &gt; Manage courses and categories. Select the category that contains the course you want to delete. Click on the Delete Icon next to the course name. Click on the Delete button.

#  **DSpace 8 Workflow**

### Submitter

###  Step 1: Log in Securely

Start by visiting your institution’s DSpace site. Instead of a regular username and password, you’ll log in using your **EduID or Shibboleth** account — that’s your university email or ID. Once you're in, you're ready to go!

---

###  Step 2: Start a New Submission

1. Look at the **top-right corner** and click your name.
2. Select **MyDSpace** from the dropdown.
3. On the next page, click the **➕ plus icon** or "Start a New Submission".
4. Choose the correct collection to submit to — for example:

>  `Faculty of Science > Computer Science > Final Year Projects 2024`

This tells the system where your paper belongs.

###  Step 3: Add Your Research Details

Now it’s time to enter your paper’s info .

#### What you’ll definitely fill in:

* **Title**: *AI-Based Traffic Management System*
* **Author(s)**: *John Doe*
* **Date**: *2025-04-25*
* **Abstract**: *A smart traffic solution using computer vision and machine learning.*
* **Language**: `English`

#### Optional but helpful info (add these if you can):

* **Publisher**: e.g., *Department of Computer Science*
* **Citation**: If published elsewhere
* **Report No.**: If it’s part of a series
* **Identifiers**: Like a DOI or ISBN
* **Type**: Thesis? Project? Choose from the list
* **Sponsors**: Who funded or supported your work
* **Description**: Anything extra you'd like to add

###  Step 4: Upload Your File

Now upload your actual research paper (PDF or Word doc). You can add multiple files if needed — like supporting images, datasets, or presentations.

---

###  Step 5: Review the License

You'll be shown a **deposit license** — this basically says DSpace is allowed to keep and share your work (but you still own the copyright).

Take a quick read and click **Agree** to continue.

###  Step 6: Finalize Your Submission

You're almost there! Let’s go over the three buttons you'll see:

| **Button**         | **What It Means**                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Save for Later** | Pauses your submission so you can finish it later (you’ll find it in MyDSpace).             |
| **Save**           | Moves to the next step and keeps what you’ve entered so far.                                |
| **Deposit**        |  This officially sends your paper for review. Click it when you're done! |

>  Once you click **Deposit**, your paper goes into the review process.

---

###  Step 7: What Happens Next?

Your paper now enters the **workflow process**, where it’ll pass through three roles:

1. **Reviewer**: Makes sure the submission follows standards, checks for plagiarism, and quality.
2. **Editor**: Might clean up the metadata or give feedback.
3. **Final Editor**: Gives the final approval and publishes your paper in the repository.

You can keep track of where your paper is anytime by visiting **MyDSpace → Workflow Tasks**.
